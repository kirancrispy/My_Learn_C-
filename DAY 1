C++ is a cross-platform, high-performance language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as a C extension. 
It offers extensive control over system resources and memory.
Major updates include C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20

In this field we are using c++ right now
*Software Development: C++ is extensively used in software development for applications ranging from desktop software to operating systems.
*Game Development: Many game engines and AAA games are built using C++ due to its high performance and control over hardware resources.
*System Programming: C++ is commonly used for system-level programming tasks such as developing device drivers, network protocols, and operating systems components.
*Embedded Systems: C++ is popular in embedded systems programming due to its efficiency and ability to directly interact with hardware.
*Financial Software: C++ is used in the development of financial software for tasks such as algorithmic trading, risk management, and high-frequency trading systems.
*Scientific Computing: C++ is used in scientific computing applications such as simulations, computational modeling, and data analysis due to its performance capabilities.
*Graphics and Multimedia: C++ is employed in the development of graphics engines, multimedia applications, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) due to its efficiency and compatibility with graphics libraries like OpenGL and DirectX.
*Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: C++ is utilized in AI and machine learning applications, especially in performance-critical tasks where efficiency is crucial.
*Web Browsers: Components of web browsers, particularly rendering engines and JavaScript interpreters, are often written in C++ for their performance requirements.
*Operating Systems Development: C++ is used in the development of operating systems due to its low-level capabilities and control over system resources.

Why it is
Versatile Presence: C++ is widely used across operating systems, GUIs, and embedded systems.
Structured Efficiency: With its object-oriented nature, C++ provides clear program structure, fostering code reuse and cost-effective development.
Platform Flexibility: Its portability enables the creation of adaptable applications for various platforms.
Enjoyable Learning Curve: Many find C++ fun and accessible to learn.
Smooth Transition: Its close relationship with C, C#, and Java facilitates seamless switching between languages for programmers.

Engin started Right now Hurry up dude -
To start using C++, you need two things: A text editor, like Notepad, to write C++ code
A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C++ code into a language that the computer will understand
Otherwise you can use Online c++ compiler for basic practice i suggest goto IDE

C++ Quickstart
Let's create our first C++ file.
Open Codeblocks and go to File > New > Empty File.
Write the following C++ code and save the file as myfirstprogram.cpp (File > Save File as).


myfirstpro1.cpp- 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}

Don't worry u ll learn about this in detaile later. and execute this program you ll get  out put "Hello World!" right hahaaa lets drink 1 glass off water dea and lets start.
what i am doing here, Try it Yourself use tool, i will make it easier for you to understand every part as we move forward.

lets jump to syntax part
In program see first Line:    #include <iostream>: Imports the input-output stream library, enabling the use of objects like cout for output.
In second Line:               using namespace std: Grants access to the standard library's objects and variables with shorter syntax.
Don't worry if you don't understand These lines are typically included in C++ programs for basic input and output operations.
Line 3: A blank line. C++ ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.
Line 4: Another thing that always appear in a C++ program is int main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.
Line 5: cout (pronounced "see-out") is an object used together with the insertion operator (<<) to output/print text. In our example, it will output "Hello World!".
Note: Every C++ statement ends with a semicolon ;.
Note: The body of int main() could also been written as:
int main () { cout << "Hello World! "; return 0; }
Remember: The compiler ignores white spaces. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable.
Line 6: return 0 ends the main function.
Line 7: Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket } to actually end the main function.
Some C++ programs may omit "using namespace std" and instead use the "std::" prefix for certain objects.
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello World!";     //wher used std:: where :: it is  scope operator
  return 0;
}
                                 //It is up to you if you want to include the standard namespace library or not.

lets start Out put :-
output is typically done using the cout object from the <iostream> library

lets see example :- 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  cout << "Hello Dea Students";
  return 0;
}

guess what is output for this program....... the output is :- " Hello Dea Students " 
You can add as many cout objects as you want. However, note that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output

Another example for u Dea:- 

                              #include <iostream>
                              using namespace std;
                              int main() {
                              cout << "Hello";
                              cout << "I am learning C++";
                              return 0;
                              }
                                    output is: Hello
                                               I am learning C++
and next move on to next
New Lines:-To insert a new line, you can use the \n character
lets see Example

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  cout << "Hello World! \n\n";
  cout << "I am learning C++";
  return 0;
}
output: Hello World!
                              // where its giving two line space 
        I am learning C++

Another way to insert a new line, is with the endl manipulator:
Example
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
  cout << "I am learning C++";
  return 0;
}
output:- Hello World!
         I am learning C++

Both \n and endl are used to break lines. However, \n is most used.
But what is \n exactly?
The newline character (\n) is called an escape sequence, and it
forces the cursor to change its position to the beginning of the next line on the screen. This results in a new line.
\t	Creates a horizontal tab	
\\	Inserts a backslash character (\)	
\"	Inserts a double quote character
use these all in program 

Lets see C++ Comments:-
Comments can be used to explain C++ code, and to make it more readable.
It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.
Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined.

Lets see Single-line Comments
Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).
Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by the compiler (will not be executed).
This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code

ex:- // This is a comment
       cout << "Hello World!";
       which program not executing the comment line i.ecomment line specification.

This example uses a single-line comment at the end of a line of code:= 
cout << "Hello World!"; // This is a comment

C++ Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.
Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by the compiler:
Example
/* The code below will print the words Hello World!
to the screen, and it is amazing */
cout << "Hello World!";

i thought you are getting some quations Why Single or multi-line comments?
If we use in the middele of the program becuse want to undrustand program or want ell something for developer like that and if we usei thought we can undrustand esyly
It is up to you which you want to use. Normally, we use // for short comments, and /* */ for longer.

K just practice this all today with more example create your own and practice lets see Tomorrow bye .
